3. Gantt Chart View (Weekly Progress)

Each task is mapped week by week from 01-Jan-2025 (Week 1) to 21-Jun-2025 (Week 25).

Green bars represent active task durations.

Light green/dark green shades show varying task progress within that period.

The timeline clearly shows overlaps and dependencies between tasks.

4. Progress Tracking

Each task has a progress percentage (e.g., 50%, 65%, 75%).

These percentages help track whether the project is on time, delayed, or ahead.

Review stage tasks are ongoing till the current week (Week 25).
